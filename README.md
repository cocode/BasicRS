BasicRS is a Rust implementation of a BASIC Interpreter 

It's part of a family of BASIC interpreters that started with 
TrekBasic, written in Python, and TrekBasicJ, written in Java.

TrekBasic was hand-written, but BasicRS was mostly translated by AI
from TrekBasic.

My goal was to be able to play the old Star Trek game, which was written in BASIC.

I have achieved that goal.
